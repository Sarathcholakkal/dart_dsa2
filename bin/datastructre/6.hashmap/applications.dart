// A real-time application of a hash table is looking up user data in a database based on their username or ID, allowing for fast retrieval of information like profile details or login status, essentially acting like a quick "lookup" function in applications like social media platforms or online banking systems where rapid access to user data is crucial. 
// Other real-time applications of hash tables include:
// Caching mechanisms:
// Web servers use hash tables to store frequently accessed data in memory for fast retrieval, reducing database load. 
// Password verification:
// When a user logs in, the system quickly compares their entered password with the hashed version stored in the database using a hash table. 
// Network routing:
// Routers can use hash tables to efficiently look up destination IP addresses and determine the best route to send packets. 
// Data deduplication:
// Identifying and removing duplicate data in large datasets by using hash tables to check if a new piece of data already exists. 
// Spell checking:
// By storing a dictionary of words in a hash table, a spell checker can quickly look up if a word is valid. 
// Key points about hash tables in real-time applications:
// Fast lookups:
// The primary benefit of a hash table is the ability to quickly retrieve data using a key, making it ideal for applications requiring fast access to information. 
// Efficient data storage:
// Hash tables can store large amounts of data efficiently by mapping keys to specific locations in memory. 
// Collision handling:
// While hash tables can experience collisions (multiple keys mapping to the same location), techniques like chaining or open addressing can mitigate this issue.
